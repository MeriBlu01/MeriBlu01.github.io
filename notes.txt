* Next.js --------------------------------------
Next.js’ Pages Router es un framework completo de React. 
Es versátil y te permite crear aplicaciones React de cualquier tamaño, 
desde un blog mayormente estático hasta una aplicación dinámica compleja. 
Para crear un nuevo proyecto de Next.js, ejecuta en tu terminal:

-> npx create-next-app@latest


* DOM ------------------------------------------
The DOM is an object representation of the HTML elements. 
It acts as a bridge between your code and the user interface, 
and has a tree-like structure with parent and child relationships.


* JSX ------------------------------------------
JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to describe your UI in 
a familiar HTML-like syntax. The nice thing about JSX is that apart from following 
three JSX rules, you don't need to learn any new symbols or syntax outside of HTML 
and JavaScript.

But browsers don't understand JSX out of the box, so you'll need a JavaScript compiler, 
such as a Babel, to transform your JSX code into regular JavaScript.


* REACT CORE CONCEPTS ------------------------------------------

-> Components
    User interfaces can be broken down into smaller building blocks called components.
    Components allow you to build self-contained, reusable snippets of code. 
    If you think of components as LEGO bricks, you can take these individual 
    bricks and combine them together to form larger structures. 
    If you need to update a piece of the UI, you can update the specific component or brick.

    In React, components are functions. Inside your <script> tag.
